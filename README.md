# Combat Effects Tracker

> This module for Foundry VTT allows you to track temporary effects by adding them to the combat tracker. 

## Requirements

There are no other modules required for this to work, but it synergizes well with the *Add Temporary Combatant* functionality of the <a href="https://github.com/death-save/combat-utility-belt">Combat Utility Belt</a> module, as it allows you to quickly add temporary effects.

## Installation

Paste the following link in the *Install Module* interface of your Foundry VTT instance:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MKamysz/combat-effects-tracker/master/module.json
```

## How it works

1. Set the module settings to the correct resource that you use in your Combat Tracker
2. Create a new Combatant for the desired effect and give it the [Effect] prefix, e.g. [Effect] Bardic Inspiration
3. Give the effect's Combatant an Initiative value that puts it where you want it to be in the Combat Trackerï»¿
4. Set the resource of your effect's Combatant that you track in your Combat Tracker to the desired duration in turns, e.g. Armor Class = 10 for a duration of 1 minute
5. That's it - each time the Combat Tracker reaches [Effect] Bardic Inspiration, it will reduce its Armor Class by 1, and when it reaches 0 you'll know that the effect is over!
